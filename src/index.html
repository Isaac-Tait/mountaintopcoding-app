	    <h3>Teaching myself web development one keystroke at a time</h3><br>
	  </div>

	  <p>Over the last three or four years I have built three websites <a href="http://www.fallfishtenkara.com" target="_blank" class="external-link">Fallfish Tenkara</a>, <a href="http://www.cutthroattenkara.com" target="_blank" class="external-link">Cutthroat Tenkara</a>, & <a href="http://www.macadamgrinding.com" target="_blank" class="external-link">Macadam Grinding</a> using the venerable content management system - Wordpress. Through that process of building those sites I have come to be curious how Wordpress, and all of its millions of plugins, actually work. As a stay at home dad I would like to be able to learn a skill that I can use to "make some bread" without having to leave home. So, using Digital Ocean and Codecademy I have jumped in head first, so to speak, into the coding world.</p>

	  <h4>Thank you for visiting and stay tuned as I bring my newfound skills into a tangible medium</h4><br>

	  <h2>My Roadmap</h2>
	    <ol class="coding">
    	  <li><strong>Learn HTML5</strong> - I first learned HTML2 from a friends grandpa who taught a homeschoolers curriculum. His granddaughter, Takara, was my first real crush. My original motivation for attending his class was in the hopes of catching a glimpse of Takara. Problem was I was too scared to look at her...</li>
    	  <li><strong>Learn CSS</strong> - At first I was very intimidated by CSS. Just looking at it I had <strong>NO</strong> idea what the heck was going on. However, in just a few short days of using Codecademy my understanding and comfort with CSS has grown exponentially.</li>
    	  <li><strong>Launch this website</strong> - I know I need to do something about my ever growing collection of Digital Ocean Droplets and URL's. Perhaps I will create a web developers anonymous group...</li>
    	  <li><strong>Learn JavaScript</strong> - I tried once before using a book I purchased at Barnes & Noble. The book was thicker than my Bible and <strong>WAY</strong> more dry. Let us hope this time around the learning process goes a little better...</li>
    	  <li><strong>Fine tune my web development skills with a lot of practice.</strong> This is the fun part. I have created a One Journal to keep track of all the code I am learning.</li>
