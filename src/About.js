                <p>
                    Over the course of the last four years I have built three websites -
                    <a href="http://www.fallfishtenkara.com" target="_blank" class="external-link" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Fallfish Tenkara, </a> 
                    <a href="http://www.cutthroattenkara.com" target="_blank" class="external-link" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Cutthroat Tenkara </a>, & 
                    <a href="http://www.macadamgrinding.com" target="_blank" class="external-link" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Macadam Grinding </a> 
                    using the venerable content management system - WordPress. Through that process of building those sites I became more and more curious 
                    how WordPress, and all of its millions of plugins, actually worked. Then in January 2017 my wife and I adopted a baby boy. Overnight our world
                    was turned upside down. In the end it made the most sense financially for me to stay at home with our new son while my wife pursued her medical 
                    career. I would not trade the last three year for anything, watching him grow day in and day out has changed me more deeply than I could ever 
                    put into words. As he has grown I began to realize that soon enough I would need to find a job that did not pay in dirty diapers, snuggles, 
                    late night feedings, and unscheduled hospital visits.
                <br />
                    My hope was to find a job that could allow me to work from home so that I could be around through my sons early school years. So, in March 
                    of 2019 I took the plunge and began learning Web Development with the goal to become a Full Stack Web Developer. I have made a lot of progress 
                    but if one thing has become abundantly clear to me in the 2019 it is that the learning never really stops. Everyday newer and better ideas replace 
                    todays standards. That is the nature of coding & web development.

                <h2>My Road Map</h2>

                <ol class="coding">
                    <li>
                        <strong>Learn HTML5</strong> - My first experience with computer coding happened when I was 13. A friend's grandfather 
                        offered a Wednesday evening course on HTML2. If I am totally honest though I initially took the course to see his 
                        granddaughter, Takara. Much to my surprise I became more interested in learning HTML than hoping Takara would notice me..
                        And so began my love affair with computers. 
                    </li>
                    <br />
                    <li>
                        <strong>Learn CSS</strong> - At first I was very intimidated by CSS. Just looking at it I had <strong>NO</strong> idea what the heck was going on. 
                        However, after taking a CSS course through Codecademy my understanding and comfort with CSS grew exponentially. I have continued to build my knowledge and 
                        understanding of CSS through the great course offerings from freeCodeCamp and Scrimba.

                    <br />
                    <li>
                        <strong>Launch this website</strong> - I knew I needed to do something with all this newly acquired knowledge and so the idea for this site was born. I already 
                        had three sites up and running, so why not add a fourth. This time though I was going to build it all from scratch without using any CMS or packaged code. 
                    </li>
                    <br />
                    <li>
                        <strong>Learn JavaScript</strong> - I tried once before to learn JavaScript using a book I purchased at Barnes & Noble. The book was thicker than my Bible and <strong>much </strong> 
                        more dry. After nearly a year of immersing myself in the JavaScript (EcmaScript) languages I am encouraged with how much I have absorbed. JavaScript is a powerful and useful language 
                        to understand. I am excited to continue expanding my JavaScript abilities.

                    <li>
                        <strong>Learn React</strong> - After much debate and inner turmoil I finally settled on a framework to focus the lion-share of my learning efforts on. I wish I could remember what 
                        exactly made me pick React over Vue or Angular. Scrimba has been an absolutely phenomenal learning resource for this framework. In fact mountainTopCoding(&#9968;); is a React site.

                        <strong>Complete a Google IT Support Credential Program</strong> - Google.org partnered with Institute for Veterans and Military Families 
                        <a href="https://www.military.com/daily-news/2019/05/13/google-funds-scholarships-spouses-become-it-support-specialists.html" target="_blank" class="external-link" rel="noopener noreferrer"> (IVMF), </a>
                        to provide dependents (spouses of Active duty military personnel) with access to computer IT training. 
                    <br />
                        <i>"With frequent moves and families to care for while their partners are deployed, military spouses face steep challenges when trying to land a meaningful job." 
                        - Jacqueline Fuller (google.org President)</i>
                    <br />
                    I can attest to the difficulty in finding meaningful employment as a husband of an active duty service woman. So, I was very grateful for the opportunity to pursue a
                    credential in IT Support.

                        <strong>Continue to fine tune my web development skills with a lot of practice</strong> - This is the part where I get to put all my newfound skills to 
                        work in one place. It has been fun to keep track of my learning journey by journaling almost everyday. 
                        Some days, and even some weeks, I have struggled to even turn my computer on. While other weeks I stay up for hours at night furiously typing away on my keyboard.
