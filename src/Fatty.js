            <p>
                Over the last three or four years I have built three websites <a href="http://www.fallfishtenkara.com" target="_blank" class="external-link" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fallfish Tenkara</a>, 
                <a href="http://www.cutthroattenkara.com" target="_blank" class="external-link" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cutthroat Tenkara</a>, & <a href="http://www.macadamgrinding.com" target="_blank" class="external-link" rel="noopener noreferrer">Macadam Grinding</a> 
                using the venerable content management system - Wordpress. Through that process of building those sites I have come to be curious how Wordpress, and all of its millions of plugins, actually work. 
                As a stay at home dad I would like to be able to learn a skill that I can use to "make some bread" without having to leave home. So, using Digital Ocean and Codecademy I have jumped in head first, so to speak, into the coding world.
