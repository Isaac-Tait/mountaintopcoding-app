                Over the last three or four years I have built three websites <a href="http://www.fallfishtenkara.com" target="_blank" class="external-link" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fallfish Tenkara, </a> 
                <a href="http://www.cutthroattenkara.com" target="_blank" class="external-link" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cutthroat Tenkara</a>, & <a href="http://www.macadamgrinding.com" target="_blank" class="external-link" rel="noopener noreferrer">Macadam Grinding </a> 
                using the venerable content management system - Wordpress. Through that process of building those sites I have come to be curious how Wordpress, and all of its millions of plugins, actually work. 
                On top of that curiousity, as a stay at home dad I of a toddler I began to look for job opportunities that I could pursue while remaining at home with my son. So, using Digital Ocean, AWS, Netlify, freeCodeCamp, Codecademy, Coursera, and Scrimba 
                I have jumped in head first into teaching myself to become a full stack web developer.

            <h2>My Roadmap</h2>
	        <ol class="coding">
                <li><strong>Learn HTML5</strong> - I first learned HTML2 from a friends grandpa who taught a homeschoolers curriculum. His granddaughter, Takara, was my first real crush. My original motivation for attending his class was in the hopes of catching a glimpse of Takara. Problem was I was too scared to look at her.</li>
                <li><strong>Learn CSS</strong> - At first I was very intimidated by CSS. Just looking at it I had <strong>NO</strong> idea what the heck was going on. However, in just a few short days of using Codecademy my understanding and comfort with CSS has grown exponentially. I have continued to build my knowledge and 
                    understanding of CSS through the great course offerings from freeCodeCamp and Scrimba.</li>
                <li><strong>Launch this website</strong> - I know I need to do something about my ever growing collection of Digital Ocean Droplets and URL's. Perhaps I will create a web developers anonymous group.</li>
                <li><strong>Learn JavaScript</strong> - I tried once before using a book I purchased at Barnes & Noble. The book was thicker than my Bible and <strong>much</strong> more dry. Let us hope this time around the learning process goes a little better.</li>
                <li><strong>Learn React</strong>After much debate and innner turmoil I finally settled on a framework to focus the lionshare of my learning efforts on.</li>
                <li><strong>Continue to fine tune my web development skills with a lot of practice.</strong> This is the part where I get to put all my newfound skills to work in one place. It has been fun to keep track of my learning journey by journaling almost everyday. 
                    Some days, and even some weeks, I have struggled to even turn my computer on. While other weeks I stay up for hours at night furiously banging away on my keyboard.</li>
